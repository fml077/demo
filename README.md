## Try it

[https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo)

## Use your own data

Fork it and change `db.json` values or create a repo with a `db.json` file.
How to
Create a repository on GitHub (<your-username>/<your-repo>)
Create a db.json file
Visit https://my-json-server.typicode.com/<your-username>/<your-repo> to access your server
No registration. Nothing to install.

Example
You can check the following server as an example:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo

Alpha
For the moment, the project is in alpha which means many things may change or break:

URLs may change
Service may be down
Authentication may be added later
etc...
Use it at your own risk. If you need a reliable solution, please install JSON Server.

Limits
To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

Changes are faked and aren't persisted (just like JSONPlaceholder)
Requests are cached (1 minute)
db.json has limits
All servers are public
Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)
